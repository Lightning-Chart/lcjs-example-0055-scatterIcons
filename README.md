This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

Example showcasing use of custom Icons as shape of a Point series.
In this example, a .png image asset of a flag is loaded as a custom icon, and used as the shape of a point series.
This point series is then used to display flag annotations bound to a timestamp that can be dragged and dropped by the user. The flags are also available as different colors.

As such, this also showcases a simple example of chart as a drag & drop target.
